# Gripper-Robot
Constructed a Gripper robot using aluminum building material and high torque servo motors connected to a central microcontroller.  
The robot allows motion of the gripper arm in a circular arc motion allowing a motion range of 0-180 degrees in the flat horizontal plane. 
This motion is supported by a roller wheel that endures the load of the arm.
Additionally, the robot is also equipped with 2 motion axis' in the vertical plane allowing the robot to reach any point in the respective plane.
